# Student-And-administration-management-system-Mid-Project-
This application serves as a comprehensive management system for educational institutes. Users have the ability to efficiently manage student data, including adding, removing, updating, and viewing student profiles. Additionally, the system provides flexibility in creating new Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs), assessments, and generating results based on these assessments.

One of the key features is the ability to define rubrics and corresponding rubric levels tailored to each CLO. These rubrics serve as a structured framework for evaluating student performance. Based on the rubric levels, the system automatically generates results for all active students.

In summary, this application streamlines educational administration by offering tools for student data management, CLO and assessment creation, and automated result generation based on predefined evaluation criteria.
